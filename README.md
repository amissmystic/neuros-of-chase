This Godot 4 game was created for [Neurosama Game Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/neuro) themed "Remnants of the Past" in December 2024 which lasted for 3 days.
It's a single-player, turn-based treasure hunt, memory and deduction game which was created with Neuro and her [SDK](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk) in mind.
